## 1️⃣ Do more skills get you better pay?

### 🔍 Skill: Power Query (ETL)

#### 📥 Extract

I first used Power Query to extract the original data (`data_salary_all.xlsx`) and create two queries:
- 🗃️ The first with all the data jobs information.
- 🔧 The second listing the skills for each job ID.

#### 🔄 Transform

Then, I transformed each query by:
- Changing column types
- Removing unnecessary columns
- Cleaning text to eliminate specific words
- Trimming excess whitespace
